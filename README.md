# facial_recognition_optimization

An implementation of a facial recogntion system based on CNNs. The trained models has been optimized using multiple optimization techniques such as: Training aware quantization, Post quantization, etc ...

The goal is to use the optimized models on low ressources devices such as Raspberry Pi 3 and Raspberry Pi 4.
